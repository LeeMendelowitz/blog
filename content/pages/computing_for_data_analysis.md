Title: Computing For Data Analysis

These are select lecture notes that I have written for the Coursera course
[Comuting for Data Analysis](https://www.coursera.org/course/compdata)
taught by [Roger Peng](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~rpeng/) in September 2013.
This course is about learning how to use the R programming language for data analysis.



The notes are written in R Markdown and compiled into regular markdown using
the [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) library. You can download each article
as R Markdown so you can interactively run the R code chunks in RStudio.
For more information on using R Markdown with RStudio, read [this](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/authoring/using_markdown).
