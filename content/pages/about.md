Title: About


My name is Lee Mendelowitz, and I am a PhD student in [Scientific Computation](http://amsc.umd.edu) at the University of Maryland.
I am studying computational and statistical methods for working with next generation sequencing data,
particularly in the area of genome assembly.

I started this blog to publish bits and pieces of programming notes for myself. I mostly program in Python and C++, but am making a concerted effort to gain proficiency in R.
