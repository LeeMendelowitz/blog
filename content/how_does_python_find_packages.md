Summary: Pure Magic!

I just ran into a situation where I compiled and installed Python 2.7.9 from source on Ubuntu, but Python could not find the packages I had previously installed. This naturally raises the question - how does Python know where to find packages when you call `import`? This post applies specifically to Python 2.7.9, but I'm guessing Python 3x works very similarly.

In this post I first describe how Python finds packages, and then I'll finish with the discovery I made regarding the default Python that ships with Ubuntu and how it differs from vanilla Python in how it finds packages.

## `sys.path`

Python imports work by searching the directories listed in `sys.path`. 

Using my default Ubuntu 14.04 Python:

```bash
> import sys
> print '\n'.join(sys.path)

/usr/lib/python2.7
/usr/lib/python2.7/plat-x86_64-linux-gnu
/usr/lib/python2.7/lib-tk
/usr/lib/python2.7/lib-old
/usr/lib/python2.7/lib-dynload
/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
```

So Python will find any packages that have been installed to those locations.

### How sys.path gets populated

As the [docs](https://docs.python.org/2/library/sys.html#sys.path) explain, `sys.path` is populated using
the current working directory, followed by directories listed in your `PYTHONPATH` environment variable,
followed by installation-dependent default paths, which are controlled by the `site` module.

You can read more about `sys.path` in the [Python docs](https://docs.python.org/2/library/sys.html#sys.path).

Assuming your `PYTHONPATH` environment variable is not set, `sys.path` will consist of the current working directory plus
any manipulations made to it by the `site` module.

The `site` module is automatically imported when you start Python, you can read more about how it manipulates your
`sys.path` in the [Python docs](https://docs.python.org/2/library/site.html#module-site).

It's a bit involved.


### You can manipulate `sys.path`

You can manipulate `sys.path` during a Python session and this will change how Python finds modules. For example:

```python
import sys, os

# This won't work - there is no hi module
import hi 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ImportError: No module named hi

# Create a hi module in your home directory.
home_dir = os.path.expanduser("~")
my_module_file = os.path.join(home_dir, "hi.py")
with open(my_module_file, 'w') as f:
  f.write('print "hi"\n')
  f.write('a=10\n')

# Add the home directory to sys.path
sys.path.append(home_dir)

# Now this works, and prints hi!
import hi 
print hi.a

```


### The module `__file__` attribute

When you import a module, you usually can check the `__file__` attribute of the module to see where the module is in your filesystem:

```python
> import numpy
> numpy.__file__
'/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/numpy/__init__.pyc'
```

However, the [Python docs](https://docs.python.org/2/reference/datamodel.html#the-standard-type-hierarchy) state that:

> The __file__ attribute is not present for C modules that are statically linked into the interpreter; for extension modules loaded dynamically from a shared library, it is the pathname of the shared library file.


So, for example this doesn't work:

```python
> import sys
> sys.__file__
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute '__file__'
```

It makes sense that the `sys` module is statically linked to the interpreter - it is essentially part of the interpreter!

## The `imp` module

Python exposes the entire `import` system through the [`imp` module](https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/imp.html). 
That's pretty cool that all of this stuff is exposed for us to abuse, if we wanted to.

`imp.find_module` can be used to find a module:

```python
> imp.find_module('numpy')
(None, '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/numpy', ('', '', 5))
```

You can also `import` and arbitrary Python source as a module using `imp.load_source`. This is the same example before,
except imports our module using `imp` instead of by manipulating `sys.path`:

```python
import sys, os

# Create a hi module in your home directory.
home_dir = os.path.expanduser("~")
my_module_file = os.path.join(home_dir, "hi.py")
with open(my_module_file, 'w') as f:
  f.write('print "hi"\n')
  f.write('a=10\n')

# Load the hi module using imp
hi = imp.load_source('hi', my_module_file)

# Now this works, and prints hi!
import hi 
print hi.a # a is 10!
print type(hi) # it's a module!
```

Passing `'hi'` to `imp.load_source` simply sets the `__name__` attribute of the module.


## Ubuntu Python

Now back to the issue of missing packages after installing a new version of Python compiled from source. By comparing the 
`sys.path` from both the Ubuntu Python, which resides at `/usr/bin/python`, and the newly installed Python, which
resides at `/usr/local/bin/python`, I could sort things out:

### Ubuntu Python (`/usr/bin/python`):

```bash
>>> import sys
>>> print '\n'.join(sys.path)

/usr/lib/python2.7
/usr/lib/python2.7/plat-x86_64-linux-gnu
/usr/lib/python2.7/lib-tk
/usr/lib/python2.7/lib-old
/usr/lib/python2.7/lib-dynload
/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
```

### Python compiled from source (`/usr/local/bin/python`)
```bash
>>> import sys
>>> print '\n'.join(sys.path)

/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
/usr/local/lib/python27.zip
/usr/local/lib/python2.7
/usr/local/lib/python2.7/plat-linux2
/usr/local/lib/python2.7/lib-tk
/usr/local/lib/python2.7/lib-old
/usr/local/lib/python2.7/lib-dynload
/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages
```

Turns out what mattered for me was `dist-packages` vs. `site-packages`. Using Ubuntu's Python, my packges were installed to `/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages`, whereas the new Python I installed expects packages to be installed to `/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages`. I just had to manipulate the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable to point to `dist-packages` in order to gain access to the previously installed packaged with the newly installed version of Python.

#### How did Ubuntu manipulate the `sys.path`?

So how does the Ubuntu distribution of Python know to use `/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages` in `sys.path`? It's hardcoded
into their `site` module! First, find where the `site` module code lives:

```python
> import site
> site.__file__
'/usr/lib/python2.7/site.pyc'
```

Here is an excerpt from Ubuntu Python's `site.py`, which I peeked by opening `/usr/lib/python2.7/site.py` in a text editor. First, a comment at the top:

> For Debian and derivatives, this sys.path is augmented with directories
for packages distributed within the distribution. Local addons go
into /usr/local/lib/python<version>/dist-packages, Debian addons
install into /usr/{lib,share}/python<version>/dist-packages.
/usr/lib/python<version>/site-packages is not used.

OK so there you have it. They explain how the Debian distribution of Python is different.

And now, for the code that implementes this change:

```python
def getsitepackages():
    """Returns a list containing all global site-packages directories
    (and possibly site-python).

    For each directory present in the global ``PREFIXES``, this function
    will find its `site-packages` subdirectory depending on the system
    environment, and will return a list of full paths.
    """
    sitepackages = []
    seen = set()

    for prefix in PREFIXES:
        if not prefix or prefix in seen:
            continue
        seen.add(prefix)

        if sys.platform in ('os2emx', 'riscos'):
            sitepackages.append(os.path.join(prefix, "Lib", "site-packages"))
        elif os.sep == '/':
            sitepackages.append(os.path.join(prefix, "local/lib",
                                        "python" + sys.version[:3],
                                        "dist-packages"))
            sitepackages.append(os.path.join(prefix, "lib",
                                        "python" + sys.version[:3],
                                        "dist-packages"))
        else:
            sitepackages.append(prefix)
            sitepackages.append(os.path.join(prefix, "lib", "site-packages"))
        if sys.platform == "darwin":
            # for framework builds *only* we add the standard Apple
            # locations.
            from sysconfig import get_config_var
            framework = get_config_var("PYTHONFRAMEWORK")
            if framework:
                sitepackages.append(
                        os.path.join("/Library", framework,
                            sys.version[:3], "site-packages"))
    return sitepackages
```

It's all there, if you are crazy enough to dig this deep.
