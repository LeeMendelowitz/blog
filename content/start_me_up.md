Welcome to the blog!

After a nice cup of coffee this morning, I impulsively created this blog because I don't
have a good way of storing programming notes, complete with syntax
highlighting. I have been using Google Drive, which doesn't really cut it.
I also thought it would be fun to learn
how to publish a blog using [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/) + GitHub, so there's
also that. Checkout the
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/LeeMendelowitz/blog)
for this blog! I just followed the `pelican-quickstart`, modified the Makefile, and was up and running.

I'm currently taking the Coursera course [Computing for Data Science](https://class.coursera.org/compdata-003/class) by Roger Peng, so I'll probably start off with some simple notes on R programming.
